This repository demonstrates a common Perl bug involving unexpected behavior when modifying a hash during iteration. The `bug.pl` file contains code that iterates through a hash and attempts to modify it within the loop, leading to unpredictable results. The `bugSolution.pl` file provides a corrected version that avoids this issue by creating a copy of the keys before iterating or using a different approach that avoids concurrent modification issues.
